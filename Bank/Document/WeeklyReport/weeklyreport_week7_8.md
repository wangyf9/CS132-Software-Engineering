# WeeklyReport_Week 7 & 8

## Work Done This Week

This week, we focused on editing the requirement specification document for our banking system. We made significant progress in detailing the functionalities and features of the system.

## Summary of Previous Work

In our previous work, we have identified that our banking system comprises two main components: the ATM and the mobile application (APP). However, we realized that our use cases and requirements were primarily focused on the APP. Therefore, we recognized the need to include more details about the ATM component in our system.

## Goals for Next Week

Next week, we plan to:

- Replenish the details of the ATM component in our system. We aim to define its functionalities, user interactions, and integration with the rest of the system.
- Revisit the requirements of the APP. We will review the functions and ensure that they align with our system's goals and user needs.
