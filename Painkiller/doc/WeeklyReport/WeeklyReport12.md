# Weekly Report 12

## Completed Work

### UI Framework Setup
- Successfully set up the UI framework using Tkinter.
- The UI currently includes buttons and scales for setting the baseline and bolus amounts, turning the baseline on and off, and displaying status information.
- Implemented real-time information display in the UI, which updates every second.

## Issues Encountered

### Testing Difficulties with Tkinter
- Identified challenges in performing automated tests for the UI using Tkinter.
- Unlike PyQt, Tkinter does not have a built-in testing library, which complicates the testing process.

## Plan for Next Week

### UI Improvements
- Enhance the UI to include failed operation displays. This involves creating new UI elements to inform the user when an operation (e.g., setting the baseline or bolus) fails.

### Operational and Sample Code
- Develop and integrate operational and sample code snippets, such as `set_baseline@0.01`, to demonstrate the functionality.
- Ensure these operations are clearly documented and easily accessible within the UI.
