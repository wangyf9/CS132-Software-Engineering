# Weekly Report 14

## Completed Work

### Enhanced Graph Functionality
- **Dynamic X-Axis Scaling**: Implemented a dynamic x-axis scaling mechanism for real-time graphs. The x-axis now adjusts beyond the initial 1440 minutes, accommodating extended simulation times and ensuring continuous, seamless data visualization.
- **Graph Resizing Issue Fix**: Resolved the issue where the canvas size increased when toggling the graph on and off multiple times. This fix ensures consistent canvas dimensions and a stable user experience.

### Enhanced UI Functionality
- **Button Frame Division**: Successfully divided the button frame into two sections: "Doctor Controls" and "System Controls", each with a title label for better organization and clarity.
- **Button State Management**: Implemented functionality to disable all buttons except the "Resume" button when the system is paused, preventing unintended operations and enhancing user experience.
- **Resume Functionality**: Added a "Resume" button in the `scale_frame` for users to continue operations after pausing. The "Resume" button appears centered in the `scale_frame` when the system is paused.

### Improved Messaging System
- **Custom Message Display**: Replaced message boxes with in-UI messages in the `scale_frame`. Messages display for 3 seconds, providing feedback without disrupting ongoing operations.
- **Centered Messages and Buttons**: Ensured all messages and the "Resume" button are centered in the `scale_frame`, enhancing visual alignment and user interaction.

### Graph Update and Control
- **Simulation Speed Adjustment**: Introduced a slider in the `scale_frame` to set simulation speed, ranging from 0.2s to 1.5s. This allows dynamic adjustment of the update interval for real-time graphs and system status updates.
- **Pause and Resume Handling**: Refined the pause functionality to halt the `update_by_minute` operations, ensuring accurate and controlled resumption of the simulation when "Resume" is pressed.

## Issues Encountered

### UI Element Overlap
- Encountered and resolved issues with message overlap and unintended clearing of active operations within the `scale_frame`. Messages are now isolated from other functionalities, ensuring they do not interfere with ongoing tasks.

### State Management Complexity
- Managing the enabled/disabled state of multiple UI elements introduced complexity. Ensured smooth transitions between paused and resumed states through careful state management and UI updates.

### Graph Resizing Problem
- Multiple toggles of the graph led to an increase in canvas size. This was resolved by ensuring the canvas dimensions remain consistent regardless of the number of toggles.

## Plan for Next Week

### Enhanced User Feedback
- **Detailed Error Handling**: Implement UI elements that provide detailed feedback on failed operations, including specific error messages and suggested user actions.
- **Operational Logs**: Integrate an operational log within the UI to track user actions and system responses, aiding user understanding and debugging.

### Comprehensive Testing
- **Automated Testing Framework**: Investigate and potentially integrate automated testing solutions for Tkinter to streamline the testing process. This may involve third-party libraries or custom test scripts.
- **User Testing and Feedback**: Conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback on the current UI design and functionality, identifying areas for improvement and ensuring the interface meets user needs.

### Documentation and Training
- **User Guide Development**: Create a comprehensive user guide with detailed instructions on using new UI features, adjusting simulation speed, and handling errors.
- **Training Sessions**: Plan and execute training sessions to familiarize users with the enhanced UI and new functionalities, ensuring smooth adoption and effective use of the system.
