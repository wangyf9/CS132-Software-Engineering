# Weekly Report 13

## Completed Work

### Enhanced UI Functionality
- **Button Frame Division**: Split the button frame into two sections for better organization: "Doctor Controls" and "System Controls". Each section now has a title label for clarity.
- **Button State Management**: Implemented functionality to disable all buttons except the "Resume" button when the system is paused, enhancing user experience and preventing unintended operations during pauses.
- **Resume Functionality**: Added a "Resume" button in the `scale_frame` that allows users to continue operations after pausing. The "Resume" button appears at the center of the `scale_frame` when the system is paused.

### Improved Messaging System
- **Custom Message Display**: Replaced the use of message boxes with in-UI messages that appear in the `scale_frame`. Messages now display for 3 seconds without interfering with other ongoing operations.
- **Centered Messages and Buttons**: Ensured that all messages and the "Resume" button appear centered in the `scale_frame` for better visual alignment and user interaction.

### Graph Update and Control
- **Simulation Speed Adjustment**: Introduced a slider in the `scale_frame` to set the simulation speed, ranging from 0.2s to 1.5s. This allows for dynamic adjustment of the update interval for real-time graphs and system status updates.
- **Pause and Resume Handling**: Refined the pause functionality to halt the `update_by_minute` operations, ensuring accurate and controlled resumption of the simulation when "Resume" is pressed.

## Issues Encountered

### UI Element Overlap
- Encountered issues with message overlap and unintended clearing of active operations within the `scale_frame`. Addressed this by isolating message display from other functionalities, ensuring messages do not interfere with ongoing tasks.

### State Management Complexity
- Managing the enabled/disabled state of multiple UI elements introduced complexity, especially ensuring a smooth transition between paused and resumed states. This was resolved through careful state management and UI updates.

## Plan for Next Week

### Enhanced User Feedback
- **Detailed Error Handling**: Implement UI elements that provide more detailed feedback on failed operations. This includes specific error messages and suggested actions for the user.
- **Operational Logs**: Integrate an operational log within the UI to track user actions and system responses, aiding in both user understanding and debugging.

### Comprehensive Testing
- **Automated Testing Framework**: Investigate and possibly integrate automated testing solutions for Tkinter to streamline the testing process. This may involve third-party libraries or custom test scripts.
- **User Testing and Feedback**: Conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback on the current UI design and functionality, identifying areas for improvement and ensuring the interface meets user needs.

### Documentation and Training
- **User Guide Development**: Create a comprehensive user guide that includes detailed instructions on using the new UI features, adjusting simulation speed, and handling errors.
- **Training Sessions**: Plan and execute training sessions for users to familiarize them with the enhanced UI and new functionalities, ensuring smooth adoption and effective use of the system.
